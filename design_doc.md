## Starting Design and Explanation
We decided to use Yujing Chen's Bank ATM as our starting design. There were numerous reasons for choosing this design. We felt that Yujing's design had the best UI out of all possible choices. Her ATM's UI was not only easy to use, but also felt the most fleshed out complete. Specifically, the handling of certain features such as currencies and bank accounts felt well developed and highly scalable. We felt that this would translate well into designing the UI for the stock market, which will potentially have to display many different stocks. In addition to the UI, we also liked the decomposition of the Bank ATM's classes. Specifically, the Bank ATM seemed like it was decomposed into many independent and resuseable classes. In other words, the classes were weakly coupled. Having weakly coupled classes makes it easier to split up the work between us. Because the classes have minimal dependencies, we can each work on an independent component of the project without getting blocked, which ultimately results in better teamwork. To summarize, we chose this design because of the benefits of the UI and the object design. 

## Evaluation of Starting Design
Overall, we found that our choice of starting design met our expectations but had some roadblocks we were not expecting. One of the benefits of our starting design was that the UI and implementation was well fleshed out. However as a consequence, this also meant that the logic and code was more complex, and required more time to read and understand it. We also found that we had different opinions on specific implementation details and object structure. Overall, our design worked out as planned because... (will finish once project is finished)
